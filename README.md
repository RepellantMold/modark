# Trackermeta
This is a simple library and a small utility crate that helps with parsing
data from the website called [Modarchive](https://modarchive.org), the
utility searches modarchive for the filename provided, gets the most likely
result, extracts module id and then gets the full details for it as a single
csv record which the structure of it can be seen in the lib.rs file in the
first function of the trackermeta module.
